There, they are traditionally made in group and then used as wall covering and flooring because of their thermo-regulating properties. However, I grew up in Germany and am convinced that the contrast between my two countries of origin represents a significant advantage for my work. In 2010, I moved to northern Italy for professional reasons and can now call a third country home in a way. In Turin",
